Get-Service OpernixIT
```

Expected status:

```text
Running
```

### Start the Service

```powershell
Start-Service OpernixIT
```

Restart-Service OpernixIT
```

You can also manage the service from:

```text
services.msc
```

Service name:

```text
OpernixIT
```

Display name:

```text
OpernixIT Service
```

## Windows Logs

Standard service log:

```text
C:\ProgramData\OpernixIT\logs\opernixit-service.log
```

Error log:

```text
C:\ProgramData\OpernixIT\logs\opernixit-service-error.log
```

Read the latest error entries:

```powershell
Get-Content "C:\ProgramData\OpernixIT\logs\opernixit-service-error.log" -Tail 100
```

## Windows Firewall

OpernixIT listens on TCP port `5000`.

To allow access from other computers, run PowerShell as Administrator:

```powershell
New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "OpernixIT TCP 5000" -Direction Inbound -Protocol TCP -LocalPort 5000 -Action Allow
```

Verify that the port is listening:

```powershell
Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 5000 -State Listen
```

## Windows Update

Before updating, back up:

```text
C:\ProgramData\OpernixIT
```

Run the newer `OpernixIT-Setup.exe` as Administrator and install it over the existing installation.

Leave **Fresh installation** unchecked to preserve the existing runtime configuration.

> [!CAUTION]
> Selecting **Fresh installation** resets the active setup files.
>
> Existing setup files are moved into a timestamped backup folder under:
>
> ```text
> C:\ProgramData\OpernixIT
> ```

## Windows Uninstallation

Open:

```text
Settings
→ Apps
→ Installed apps
→ OpernixIT
→ Uninstall
```

The uninstaller removes the OpernixIT Windows service and application files.

Back up the following folder before uninstalling when data must be preserved:

```text
C:\ProgramData\OpernixIT
```


## Windows Agent

The Windows endpoint agent collects device inventory and system health information and sends it to the OpernixIT server.

The agent can collect:

- Computer name
- Logged-in user
- IP address
- Domain information
- CPU information
- Memory information
- Disk capacity and usage
- Operating system information
- Last-seen status

### Agent Installation

Run PowerShell as Administrator:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process
```

Install the agent:

```powershell
.\scripts\install-agent.ps1 `
  -PackageUrl "https://YOUR-DOWNLOAD-ADDRESS/OpernixITAgent-1.0.0.zip" `
  -ServerUrl "https://YOUR-OPERNIXIT-SERVER" `
  -AgentKey "YOUR-AGENT-KEY"
```

The installation script:

- Installs the agent under `C:\Program Files\OpernixIT Agent`
- Creates the `OpernixITAgent` Windows service
- Enables delayed automatic startup
- Configures automatic service recovery
- Creates the agent configuration file
- Stores local service logs

Check the service:

```powershell
Get-Service OpernixITAgent
```

Restart the service:

```powershell
Restart-Service OpernixITAgent
```

Read the agent error log:

```powershell
Get-Content "C:\Program Files\OpernixIT Agent\agent-service-error.log" -Tail 100
```

## Active Directory Deployment

The OpernixIT Windows Agent can be distributed through Group Policy in Active Directory environments.

Recommended deployment method:

1. Store the agent package on a protected internal file share.
2. Grant domain computers read-only access.
3. Store the PowerShell installation script in a controlled deployment directory.
4. Open Group Policy Management.
5. Navigate to:

```text
Computer Configuration
└── Windows Settings
    └── Scripts
        └── Startup
```

6. Add the agent installation script.
7. Test the policy on a limited organizational unit before domain-wide deployment.
8. Use HTTPS for communication with the OpernixIT server.
9. Rotate agent keys periodically.

Never publish agent keys, API keys or credentials in a public repository.

## Reverse Proxy and HTTPS

For production deployments, place OpernixIT behind a reverse proxy such as:

- Nginx
- Caddy
- Traefik
- IIS Application Request Routing

The reverse proxy should forward traffic to:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

Recommended public address:

```text
https://itsm.example.com
```

Enable the HTTPS option in the setup wizard only after HTTPS has been configured correctly.

## Security Recommendations

- Change all default passwords.
- Use a long and unique PostgreSQL password.
- Never commit the `.env` file.
- Never publish administrator credentials.
- Never publish agent keys.
- Use HTTPS in production.
- Restrict access to port `5000`.
- Keep PostgreSQL available only through the Docker network.
- Back up PostgreSQL regularly.
- Use fixed image versions in production.
- Review application and audit logs.
- Keep Docker and the host operating system updated.

## Troubleshooting

### Image Reference Is Invalid

Error:

```text
invalid reference format
```

Check `.env`:

```env
OPERNIXIT_IMAGE=ghcr.io/shotlasts/opernixit
OPERNIXIT_VERSION=1.0.0
```

Do not include `:latest` or another tag in `OPERNIXIT_IMAGE`.

### Container Image Cannot Be Pulled

Test the image directly:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/shotlasts/opernixit:1.0.0
```

Check the resolved Compose configuration:

```bash
docker compose config | grep image
```

### Application Container Is Restarting

Check the logs:

```bash
docker compose logs --tail=150 app
```

### PostgreSQL Is Not Ready

Check the database status:

```bash
docker compose ps
docker compose logs --tail=100 db
```

### Port 5000 Is Already in Use

Change the public port in `.env`:

```env
OPERNIXIT_PORT=5050
```

Then restart:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Open:

```text
http://SERVER-IP:5050
```
